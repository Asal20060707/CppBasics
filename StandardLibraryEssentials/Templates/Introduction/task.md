In this part of the course, you will learn about such a feature of the C++ language as templates.

In essence, templates are a way to write generic code that can work with different types. They allow you to write a single function or class that can work with different types without having to write separate functions or classes for each type.

The following topics will be covered:
 * Definition of templates for functions and classes 
 * Type-inference, `auto` and `decltype` keywords, template argument deduction
 * Type aliases: `using` and `typedef`
 * Templates specialization
