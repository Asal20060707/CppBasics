In this part of the course, you will learn about the templates in the C++ language.

In essence, templates are a means to write generic code that can work with varying types. They allow you to write a single function or class that can adapt to different types, without the need to write separate functions or classes for each type.

The following topics will be covered:
 * Template functions and classes 
 * Type inference: `auto` and `decltype`
 * Template argument deduction
 * Type aliases: `using` and `typedef`
 * Template specialization
