During container exploration, we have encountered iterators many times, and it is not surprising since they are strongly tied with each other. 

In C++, [iterators](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator) are objects that allow us to traverse the container and access its elements. Basically, it is a view on an element of a container. They provide unified interface to the elements of various containers.

Iterators behave much like pointers, and in the case of certain container types, they are indeed pointers. Iterator is a way to access the elements of an array or any other container in a sequential manner without exposing the underlying representation.

An iterator must be initialized before use. You can initialize an iterator to the beginning of a container using the `begin()` function, or to one past the end of the container using the `end()` function.

You can move an iterator to the next element in the container using the `++` operator or `std::next` function. To move an iterator to the previous element, use the `--` operator or `std::prev` function. You can also move an iterator by a specified number of elements using the `+=` and `-=` operators, or by using the `std::advance` function. 

Comparison of two iterators is made by the `==` and `!=` operators, which might be useful when checking whether you've reached the end of a container.

You can access the element an iterator points to using the `*` operator. Dereferencing of `end()` iterator is undefined behavior.

Usually, type of an iterator is a long and complicated expression. To simplify the code, you can use the `auto` keyword to declare an iterator. The compiler will automatically deduce the right type of the iterator from the type of the container.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>

int main() {
    std::list<char> characters = {'i', 'a', 'm', 's', 'h', 'o', 'u', 't', 'i', 'n', 'g'};

    // Using iterators to modify elements
    for (auto it = characters.begin(); it != characters.end(); ++it) {
        *it = std::toupper(*it);
    }

    // Using iterators to access elements
    auto it = characters.begin();
    while (it != characters.end()) {
        std::cout << *it++;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
