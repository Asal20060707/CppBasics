Another form of associative containers is [`std::map`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map). It is similar to `std::set`, but stores key-value pairs. You can think of it as a dictionary. 

The keys are unique and by default sorted in ascending order. They are immutable, so you cannot change them. 
The values are not sorted and could be duplicated. 

You can always define your own sorting criteria by providing a custom comparator.

In comparison with `std::set` and `std::multiset`, `std::map` and `std::multimap` provide direct access to their elements using `operator[]` and `at()`. But be aware of the following behavior: if the key is not found, `operator[]` will insert a new element with the specified key and a default value. Method `at()` will throw an exception, if the key is not found.

```cpp
std::map<std::string, int> people;
people.insert(std::make_pair("John", 25));
people.insert({"Jane", 20});
people["John"] = 30; // will overwrite the previous value
people["Alex"] = 15; // will insert a new element
people["John"] += 5; // will increase the value
std::cout << "Number of people: " << people.size() << std::endl;
```

[`std::multimap`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/multimap) offers the same functionality as `std::map`, but allows duplicate keys.

Note that search using `find()` can only be performed by a key. There is no way to search by value, other than iterating through the whole container.

Both `std::set` and `std::map` are not stored in a contiguous memory block. So while the following code works for `std::vector`:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
int* p = &v[0];
p += 1;
std::cout << *p << std::endl; // will print 2
```

in case of associative containers, it will lead to undefined behavior:

```cpp
std::map<int, int> m = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
std::pair<const int, int>* p2 = &*m.begin();
p2 += 1;
std::cout << p2->first << ' ' << p2->second << std::endl; // Undefined behavior
```

Under the hood, both set and map containers are built on top of a [Red-black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redâ€“black_tree), which is a balanced binary search tree data structure. This allows achieving logarithmic complexity for insertion and search operations.

As a task, you need to implement a function that counts appearances of each letter in the text. The function should return a `std::map` with letters as keys and the number of appearances as values. The letters should be sorted in alphabetical order. The function should be case-insensitive, i.e., the letters "A" and "a" should be considered the same. The function should also ignore punctuation marks and numbers.
