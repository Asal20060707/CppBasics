Before that, when developing Planet Game, we focused on the implementation of basic mechanics. Now you will be asked to turn our project into a real game by adding a mandatory feature of any game â€“ a tangible goal (and, moreover, an ability to compete). 

In the following lessons, you will add the opportunity to earn points to the game and by collecting them you can compete for the first place in the leaderboard! To do this, we will need the knowledge we gained earlier: working with files, so we can store game results, and also containers from the standard library, so we can properly recalculate leaderboard standings after each game.

It would be similar to old arcade games where you could see your name on the leaderboard if you were good enough.

Here is the list of the tasks you will need to complete in the following lessons:
 * Improving Collision Detection
 * Adding Score
 * Data Retrieval
 * Leaderboard creation
