## Your first "Hello Words" in C++ 

**Welcome to the Computer Science Center C++ Basics course!**

In this course you are going to learn about this 
truly powerful language. 
As you may know, with great power comes great responsibility. 
In the case of C++ the responsibility lies on the programmer, 
that is you! 
Thus, you will learn not only how to use C++ language, 
but also how some of its features work under the hood,
in order to use them properly in your daily routine.

Did we already say that C++ is quite complex language?
It is certainly not a good pick for the first programming language 
to learn. Therefore, in this course we assume you already 
familiar with programming and/or have some experience 
with other programming languages, like Python, Kotlin, or Java. 
If not, we recommend to first start with the courses
... (link to other courses for beginners).
 
But let's start our journey into C++ with something simple and old-fashioned. 
Let's write a program that will say "Hello World!".

In C++, the entry point to the program is a distinguished function named `main`. 
Your task is add code to this function that will print string "Hello World!".

To print something in C++ one can use the following syntax:

```c++
std::cout << "Text to be printed";
```
